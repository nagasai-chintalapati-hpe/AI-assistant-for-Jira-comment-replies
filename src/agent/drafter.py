"""Draft generator – creates responses using templates + Copilot SDK.

MVP v1 flow:
  1. Select a response template based on the classification bucket.
  2. Fill the template with context (issue fields, evidence, citations).
  3. Optionally refine via Copilot SDK for natural language polish.
  4. Return a Draft with citations and suggested actions.
